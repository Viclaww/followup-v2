# Welcome to your Lovable project

## ðŸ¤– AI-Driven Development Workflow

This project now includes a **complete AI-driven development workflow** that automates the entire development cycle from issue creation to deployment!

### âœ¨ What's New

- âœ… **Automated Code Implementation**: Create an issue, AI implements it
- âœ… **AI-Generated Tests**: Automatic unit and E2E test generation
- âœ… **Auto-Fix**: AI automatically fixes failing tests
- âœ… **CI/CD Pipeline**: Linting, type checking, and testing
- âœ… **One-Command Setup**: Get started in minutes

### ðŸš€ Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Install AI workflow dependencies
./setup-ai-workflow.sh

# 2. Create a GitHub issue with the 'ai-implement' label
# 3. Watch the AI build, test, and create a PR automatically!
```
